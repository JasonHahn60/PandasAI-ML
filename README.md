# PandasAI-ML
This short project demonstrates a predictive model trained using PandasAI to forecast housing prices. Using prompt engineering and PandasAI, I can guide the model in generating code for training and result visualization.

Step 1:
Consult https://docs.pandas-ai.com/platform to get started

Step 2:
Execute this notebook in an IDE (I used VSCode)

This project illustrates how PandasAI, combined with prompt engineering, can be a powerful tool for building machine learning models.
